# Intro to CS Projects

This repo has Python projects I worked on in my first computer science class at Georgia State University. They’re small programs that helped me practice the basics like variables, input/output, loops, conditionals, functions, and simple data structures.

## Projects included
- [Gradebook Manager](josue_benz_gradebook.py) – keeps track of student grades with lists and dictionaries  
- [Vending Machine](josue_benz_food.py) – lets a user pick items, calculates totals, and gives change  
- [Password Program](josue_benz_password.py) – checks and updates passwords using string operations  
- [Number Guessing Game](josue_benz_my_number.py) – user tries to guess the random number  
- [Speeding Ticket Calculator](josue_benz_speeding.py) – tells the fine based on how fast you were going  
- [Step Counter](josue_benz_step_counter.py) – converts steps into distance  
- [Calories Calculator](josue_benz_calories.py) – simple calorie tracker  

There are also smaller practice programs like calculators, string reversers, and triangle area finders.
